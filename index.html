    marrodri personal portfolio.
    here we are going to focus on learning our own website that is going to be built
    in around 2 weeks.
    -we will copy from a html5up template and make
      look to our needs and what we want to achieve.
    what we must learn is
    -vanilla html,css structure
    -vanilla JS structure and DOM manipulation
    -SASS is a must to learn too.
    -after this we will work on firebase and the 
     backend, which is going to be another site quickly 
     built with reactJS that will connect to the DB and 
     the portfolio website will fetch the data
